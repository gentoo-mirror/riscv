		The RISC-V Proxy Kernel, pk, is a lightweight application execution environment that can host
		statically-linked RISC-V ELF binaries. It is designed to support tethered RISC-V implementations
		with limited I/O capability and thus handles I/O-related system calls by proxying them to a host
		computer.

		This package also contains the Berkeley Boot Loader, bbl, which is a supervisor execution
		environment for tethered RISC-V systems. It is designed to host the RISC-V Linux port.
